# RT-WDF

This is the RT-WDF repository. It is divided into four partitions:

## Libs:
    This folder contains the actual code of RT-WDF.
    It also contains the Linear Algebra Lib 'armadillo', and the sample rate 
    conversion framework r8brain-free
    
## wdfRenderer
    The wdfRenderer is an offline audio renderer which processes .wav files
    through WDF trees and writes an output file rtwdf.wav into your home 
    directory.
    
## Documentation:
    This folder contains documentation about the library.

## Toolchain:
